For question 2 I wanna check hiredate between 1st  January 2018 to 31st dec 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the correct and strict SQL for Q2, using an explicit date range. This is how it should be written—no shortcuts, no ambiguity.

Oracle SQL (recommended)
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE job = 'MANAGER'
AND hiredate BETWEEN DATE '2018-01-01' AND DATE '2018-12-31';
Alternative (also Oracle, old-style but valid)
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE job = 'MANAGER'
AND hiredate BETWEEN
TO_DATE('01-01-2018','DD-MM-YYYY')
AND TO_DATE('31-12-2018','DD-MM-YYYY');
Brutal truth
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hiredate)=2018 works, but it’s lazy and inefficient.

BETWEEN with proper DATE literals is cleaner, faster, and index-friendly.

This is exactly what examiners expect in a DBT lab exam.

If you want the MySQL version, ask—but don’t mix dialects in exams.

This is giving me errors
ChatGPT said:
Yes, it should give errors. Your statement has real mistakes, not Oracle being annoying. I’ll be blunt and precise.

❌ What’s wrong in your SQL
1. You literally broke a number
CHECK (balance>100
00)
That newline splits 10000 into 100 and 00.
SQL doesn’t magically fix sloppy typing.

✅ Must be:

CHECK (balance > 10000)
2. INT is not Oracle-native
Oracle accepts it sometimes as a synonym, sometimes not (depends on version/settings).

Stop relying on luck.

Use:

NUMBER
3. DECIMAL works, but NUMBER is safer in Oracle
Again, don’t gamble in exams.

✅ Correct, clean, exam-safe Oracle SQL
CREATE TABLE account (
  accno NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  accHoldername VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'mumbai'
    CHECK (city IN ('banglore','chennai','mumbai')),
  telephone_number CHAR(10),
  balance NUMBER(10,2) CHECK (balance > 10000)
);
🔥 Reality check (important)
Oracle is strict → formatting mistakes = syntax errors

Exams don’t care about “almost correct”

One broken literal (100 00) is enough to fail the command

If you want:

MySQL version

INSERT statements tested against constraints

Why DEFAULT + CHECK behaves the way it does

Say it.

I am using it on my sql
ChatGPT said:
Good you said it clearly — MySQL, not Oracle.
Your query fails because you mixed Oracle syntax with MySQL. MySQL doesn’t forgive that.

Let’s be blunt and fix it properly.

❌ Why your query FAILS in MySQL
1️⃣ VARCHAR2 ❌
MySQL does NOT support VARCHAR2.
That’s Oracle-only.

2️⃣ INT is fine, but constraints placement matters
MySQL is picky about syntax order.

3️⃣ Your number is still broken
balance>100
00
That alone is enough to throw an error.

4️⃣ CHECK works only in MySQL 8.0.16+
Older versions silently ignore CHECK.

✅ Correct MySQL version (MySQL 8+)
CREATE TABLE account (
  accno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  accHoldername VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'mumbai',
  telephone_number CHAR(10),
  balance DECIMAL(10,2),
  CHECK (city IN ('banglore','chennai','mumbai')),
  CHECK (balance > 10000)
);
🔥 If your MySQL version is OLD (very common)
Then CHECK is useless. You MUST use ENUM instead.

✅ Exam-safe, real-world MySQL solution
CREATE TABLE account (
  accno INT PRIMARY KEY,
  accHoldername VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  city ENUM('banglore','chennai','mumbai') DEFAULT 'mumbai',
  telephone_number CHAR(10),
  balance DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (balance > 10000)
);
⚠️ Hard truth you need to remember
Oracle SQL ≠ MySQL SQL

VARCHAR2 → Oracle only

MySQL is forgiving, exams are not

If examiner says MySQL, write MySQL syntax only

If you want, I can:

Convert all your earlier answers to MySQL

Give INSERT statements that won’t fail

Tell you which version your MySQL actually is

Say the word.

You said:
21) Give an example of Self join Query
22) Create a view  based on emp and dept table consisting of all columns from both the tables
23) If above view read only. Give Example of Read Only view query.


In mysql
ChatGPT said:
You’re asking basic-but-often-messed-up SQL, so I’ll be straight and precise.
All answers below are valid MySQL syntax. No Oracle crap mixed in.

21) Example of SELF JOIN (MySQL)
Classic use case: employee and their manager (same table joined with itself).

SELECT e.empno, e.ename AS employee, m.ename AS manager
FROM emp e
JOIN emp m
ON e.mgr = m.empno;
Why this is a self join:
Same table emp used twice with aliases (e, m).
If you don’t use aliases → query is impossible.

22) Create a VIEW using emp and dept (ALL columns)
Be careful:

SELECT * in views is lazy and risky, but exams allow it.

Proper join is mandatory.

CREATE VIEW emp_dept_view AS
SELECT e.*, d.*
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d
ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
This view contains all columns from emp + dept.

23) READ ONLY VIEW (MySQL)
MySQL does NOT support WITH READ ONLY like Oracle.
So stop thinking Oracle here.

✅ Correct MySQL way (using ALGORITHM = TEMPTABLE)
This forces the view to be non-updatable.

CREATE ALGORITHM = TEMPTABLE VIEW emp_dept_readonly AS
SELECT e.*, d.*
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d
ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
